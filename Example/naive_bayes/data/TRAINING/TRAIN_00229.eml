While a native connection is always best, we've used an Epson Document =
Camera (purchased off eBay) for iPhone/iPod presentations in the past =
and plan to do so next month for our iPad preso. For a NEW one I'd look =
at the Elmo brand.
Our epson can go to the Projector AND S-Video out simultaneously so that =
we can capture the feed using an EyeTV device for our recordings. Again, =
quality is what it is, but it does work for us.

See our meeting using this method here:
