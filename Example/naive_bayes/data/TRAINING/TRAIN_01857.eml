Agreed, but where do I file a bug in Debian to say that instructions on 
how to report a bug upstream and how to mark the bug originally reported 
in Debian has been forwarded upstream are lacking?

I've just attempted to do this with icedove ( 
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=579095 ) but how does 
one do this for the general case?

I found the instructions on marking a Debian bug as forwarded upstream 
not via the Debian wiki or any package's instructions on reporting bugs 
with packages upstream, but by a Google search which lead to:
http://www.debian.org/Bugs/server-control

Many packages do *not* list the upstream site for the package or how to 
report bugs upstream anywhere within /usr/share/doc/<package-name> but 
ideally they should be listed:

- in the manual page for the programs/configuration files for that package

- in /usr/share/doc/<package-name>

and in the reportbug script for that package.

I do appreciate all the work of the Debian developers/packagers/release 
people, but please help "fill in the gaps" or "connect the dots" on how 
to go about reporting bugs that may affect both Debian users and the 
upstream package.

Arthur.
