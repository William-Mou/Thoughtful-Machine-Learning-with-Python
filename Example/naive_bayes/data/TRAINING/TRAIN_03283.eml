Re 1. Your swap partition's UUID must be different. Check
"/etc/initramfs-tools/". There is a "resume" file (in that dir or in a
subdir) that will have your swap partition's UUID.

Re 2. What do you mean by "After changing the UUID of the new
partition"? After "dd...", did your run "tune2fs -U ..." on your root
partition (or the equivalent for xfs, ...; I am assuming that you have
just one partition)? If you didn't, your root partition still has the
same UUID and update-grub is picking it up correctly (in which case, I
have no idea idea how you are booting up!).
