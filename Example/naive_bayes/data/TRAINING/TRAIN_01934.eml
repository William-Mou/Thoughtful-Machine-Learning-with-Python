euok draft 1 1




  Hi Everyone,



  For all our new members welcome.


 
  



  We are pleased and excited to release our latest pick Euoko Group Inc, =
trading symbol EUOK.


 
  



  EUOK is an elite manufacturer of luxury based beauty products, with a f=
ocus in anti aging and wrinkle prevention.


 
  



  EUOK gross profit has grown by 102% for the three months ended January =
31, 2010 compared to the three months ended January 31, 2009. Gross profi=
t margin for the three months ended was 81%.  Sales increased by 88% for =
the three months ended January 31, 2010 when compared to the same period =
in the prior year.


 
  



  EUOK gross profit has grown by 57% for the six months ended January 31,=
 2010 compared to the six months ended January 31, 2009. Gross profit mar=
gin for the six months ended was 79%.  Sales increased by 49% for the six=
 months ended January 31, 2010 when compared to the same period in the pr=
ior year.


 
  



  When benchmarked against its industry competitors Revlon (REV:NYSE), Es=
tee Lauder (EL:NYSE), Shiseido, and LVMH (Euronext: MC), EUOK has had sig=
nificantly more sales growth when compared to the same period in the prio=
r year.

  The growth in sales is primarily due to the EUOK brand becoming more es=
tablished in the premium cosmetic channels.  


 
  



  EUOK current trading price of 0.40 is a steal. We have been following t=
he cosmetics and beauty industry now for quite some time. According to Fo=
rbes.com who did an article on the growth of the cosmetics industry, beau=
ty products generate nearly 230 billion annually in global sales, with a =
consumer preference placed on products that are high tech and natural bas=
ed (favoring companies like EUOK). With the current status of the company=
, EUOK is poised to grab no less than 1% of global sales, ensuring 230 mi=
llion in gross sales for EUOK. Based off revenue alone that would warrant=
 a $6.57 share price.


 
  



  The financials speak for themselves; EUOK is set to make a run and is e=
xtremely undervalued.


 
  



  In the past, large multinational corporations have dominated the market=
 place, but in recent years boutique brands such as EUOK have been at the=
 fore front of consumer spending. EUOK is ready to take full advantage of=
 this. Data released from the NPD Group (a marketing info company based i=
n New York) says luxury cosmetics have grown at an annual rate of 4% - 7%=
 since 2002. Estee lauder and L=E2=80=99Oreal have realized this and have=
 been acquiring companies like EUOK in order to meet the demand of consum=
ers.



  There are several reasons behind the growth in high-end cosmetics: the =
expansion of new markets in Russia and Asia; changing social norms that m=
ake using cosmetics--not to mention undergoing cosmetic surgery--more acc=
eptable; celebrity worship; promotion within fashion magazines; improveme=
nts in the technology that creates makeup; the influence of mass retailer=
s that can offer lower prices, and raising affluence. As cosmetics become=
s less expensive, better and more accessible, more affluent women--and in=
creasingly men as well--have moved away from older brands of makeup and s=
kincare in search of higher-quality new products and more exclusivity. 



  EUOK recognizes this and has gained retail distribution worldwide throu=
gh its relationships with department store retail giants such as Barneys =
New York, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus, Bliss, Harr=
ods (London), Printemps (France), La Rinascente (Italy) and Lane Crawford=
 (Hong Kong).



  Upper management of EUOK has a three prong approach to further drive gl=
obal brand recognition:


 
  



  North America 

  EUOK strategy in North America is one of strong luxury brand positionin=
g through partnerships with premier department stores and flagship locati=
ons. EUOK department store partners include Bergdorf Goodman in New York =
City, Barneys New York nationwide, Ogilvy, as well as boutique-style depa=
rtment stores across USA and Canada. EUOK also operates brand-owned flags=
hip stores in Toronto and Vancouver. EUOK subsidiary, Hewitt-Vevey, is po=
sitioned in medical facilities and online, with p
lans to grow in both directions. Future expansion plans include creating =
new partnerships with other major department stores, as well as positioni=
ng with 5-star hotels in key markets. 

   

  Europe 

  EUOK distribution in Europe varies by market but is restricted to luxur=
y channels that position the brand amongst the leading luxury skincare br=
ands. Our representation includes department stores and perfumeries in ma=
jor markets. These channels include Printemps in France, Harrods and Libe=
rty in the UK, La Rinascente in Italy, as well as perfumeries in other co=
untries. Expansion plans for Europe are focused primarily in the UK and F=
rance with negotiations with premier department stores under way. 

   

  



  Asia 

  EUOK distribution in Asia varies by country for best positioning amongs=
t the leading luxury brands. Our major department store partner in Hong K=
ong is Lane Crawford, as well as Joyce. We are also represented through l=
uxury perfumeries and spas in Singapore and South Eastern China. Asia rep=
resents our largest immediate growth potential. We are in communication w=
ith major department stores and distributors in Japan, South Korea, Taiwa=
n and other major markets in China. We expect new accounts for EUOK, as w=
ell as major interest in WhiteRX, an upcoming product of our subsidiary, =
Hewitt-Vevey, to drive significant growth in Asia. We are also in communi=
cation with major retailers in the Middle East and Russia, two high-poten=
tial markets in which we 
are not yet present.

 
  


 
  



  Corporate Summary

 
  



  With confidence, we welcome you to Euoko, an exclusive brand that repre=
sents the cornerstone of the most innovative, most unique skin treatments=
. Euoko indeed stands at the intersection of the most noble of commitment=
s to effective active technology, unsurpassed delivery systems, uncomprom=
ised service and a modern, understated image.


 
  



  Our constantly growing library of active principles currently exhibits =
102 ingredients from Switzerland, Spain, France, Canada, Denmark, the Uni=
ted States, the Amazonian Rainforest, the Kalahari Desert and Denmark. Fr=
om our most unique hyaluronic acid with no animal origins or strepp bacte=
ria derivatives to our recent addition of an extraordinarily effective, a=
ge-killing peptide that fully mimics Waglerin 1, a peptide that is found =
in the venom of the Temple Viper, Tropidolaemus wagleri, we stand strongl=
y behind the innovative collection of the noble ingredients found in our =
products. Both the safety and effectiveness of our ingredients are import=
ant to us. We avoid unnecessary preservation or stabilization and respond=
 rapidly to emerging innovations in biotechnology, nanotechnology, biolog=
y, peptides and other active principles.


 
  



  Further, our proprietary delivery system ensures maximum stability and =
absorption of our active principles into the skin. This delivery system i=
s the single key catalyst that maximizes the effectiveness of our princip=
les, while making it possible for high concentrations of our principles t=
o be included synergistically in our formulations. Highlights of this sys=
tem include a strain of red marine algae that maximizes penetration of ac=
tives into the skin by causing a controlled immune response when applied =
topically. This effect is enhanced by the delivery action of our micro-su=
rfactants bound to a pure grade of hyaluronic acid, as well as our unique=
 timed-release technology. Every Euoko product embodies Euoko=E2=80=99s c=
ommitment to science and quality. When you purchase a Euoko treatment, yo=
