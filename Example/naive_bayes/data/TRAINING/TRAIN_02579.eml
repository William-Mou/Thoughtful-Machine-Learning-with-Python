The out-of-process Plugin2 should work fine on 32-bit only Macs.

Switching between the in and out-of-process plugins is a simple matter =
of adding or removing a symlink to the in-process plugin to =
/Library/Internet Plug-Ins. You should only see grey radio buttons in =
Java Preferences if you don't have write permissions in that directory. =
It's possible that if you have other Java plugins present in your =
~/Library/Internet Plug-Ins folder, that could be confusing the =
logic...maybe.

Can you "ls -al@e /Library/Internet\ Plug-ins" and "ls -al@e =
~/Library/Internet\ Plug-ins" to see what plugins are present, and if =
there are any funny ACLs or extended attributes?

Best of luck,
