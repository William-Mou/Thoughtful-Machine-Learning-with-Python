But I have to _look_ at them to turn them off.  In KDE 3 I do not.  I can t=

them off without ever having to see them.

Bully for your mother and your autistics.  They make me feel sick and trigg=

They do not.  They are much more complicated than in KDE 3 and you have to=

type more to be offered anything.

No, it's alt+F1 in KDE 3.5.x.  Alt+F5, which I also like and use a lot, bri=
ngs=20
up a list of running windows.

But I don't _like_ KDE 4 and I do, very much, like KDE 3.  I like Kcontrol=

better than those work-arounds.

Why?  You will only tell me that I have not got your petrmission to=20

I have not evaded the question.  I have pointed out that I prefer things th=
at=20
are functional to things that are showy.  As I stated at the beginning.  As=
=20
someone else has pointed out, KDE 4 has had 2 years to become half way=20
bearable and has signally failed.  I mourn the passing of KDE 3.5.x, which =
I=20
regard as the pinnacle of DE's.  In other words, we have come full circle a=
nd=20
are back at the beginning.  You have to learn to accept that not everyone=20
agrees with you.

And, I fear that the lengths you are going to to try and persuade me that I=
 am=20
wrong, even to the extent of telling me that I am only allowed to be made i=
ll=20
by something that also makes your mother ill, do not strike me as helping m=
e.
