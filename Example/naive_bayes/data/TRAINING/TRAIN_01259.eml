That's not a difference. I don't use it, either. My use of Compiz was 
just a part of exploration of the Gnome DE. I don't even use Gnome now.

Neither do I. That's why I use Xfce.

I occasionally turn on Xfce's compositing for specific tasks in which it 
actually makes my work easier. But most if the time, it's off.

nv - Debian Squeeze

Gave up finally in December last year trying to get the blobs to work 
reliably. They're simply not worth the effort for someone with my 
particular needs.

I'm reasonably happy with the systems with the nvidia workstation cards. 
But the cheaper systems with Intel and ATI graphics are faster and 
handle any special effects I might want (like occasional use of desktop 
compositing) better, and I'm happier with them. Nvidia is simply not on 
my radar for any future systems because I consider their approach to 
Linux to be inimical to FOSS.

PS: My apologies. Recent update to my mail client coupled with lack of 
sleep. I accidentally sent Ron a direct e-mail reply. Mea culpa.
