The problem is: either you give data to some dishonest person or you
don't give that data to some dishonest person. Tertium non datur.

FWIW, if you'd like to rely on such a scheme for security by obstacles,
you'd have to use something else than pdf. pdf's scheme is broken.
That's all.

The reason that it is broken for pdfs is that the specifications for pdf
are freely available, and thus alternative pdf readers have been
developed. Your scheme would require closed specifications and closed
software to work. This list, however, is all about free software.
