Triying with dragonplayer it also fails with xine backend, amarok and
kaffeine on the other hand play it complete.

Switched to gstreamer backend and DragonPlayer played it successfully.

I think you may have to file two separate bugreports: one to k3b
suggesting as a new feature to use ogg files instead of wavs; and a
separate to phonon indicating to xine backend fails to play k3b's
files.

But since it does play ok with amarok (which also uses phonon)
probably will be nice to ask this question to a phonon developer,
maybe that the issue is in k3b and dragonplayer.

Cheers,
Ismael
