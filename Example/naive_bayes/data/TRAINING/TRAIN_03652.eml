If file integrity are important to you, look for a FS that keeps 
checksums of individual files.  Otherwise, if a file becomes corrupted, 
you'll never know it, unless you keep your own checksums.  There are 
only a small handful of filesystems that keep checksums of your files.  
Btrfs and ZFS come to mind.  I believe ZFS is more mature than Btrfs, 
but it isn't in the kernel.  I believe the only way to get ZFS on Linux 
is through FUSE.

There's also JFS, which has been around for a number of years, and is 
mature.  It doesn't checksum your files, but it does use copy-on-write 
(as do Btrfs and ZFS), which goes a long way to keeping your data from 
getting corrupted, something XFS does not do.

So if Btrfs were more mature, or if ZFS were included in the kernel, I'd 
recommend either of those.  But as it is, I think JFS is the way to go.
