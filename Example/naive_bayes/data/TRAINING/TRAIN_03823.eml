Mike,

Thanks for explaining this, and clarifying the situation.

I can report that I indeed did not have sufficient privileges. So I
logged in as somebody who does, and was able to change the preference,
and everything* now works as advertised.

*except for two-finger scrolling in 1.6.0_20 own-process applets whose
browser window is displayed on my secondary display! Please see bug id
8017275.

Thanks for your help,

Rob
