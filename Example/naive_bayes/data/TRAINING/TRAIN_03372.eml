I installed xserver-xorg-core-nouveau (1:0.0.15+git20100329+7858345-3) of
squeze.  My video card is an inbuilt one.
00:0d.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation C61 [GeForce 7025 /
nForce 630a] (rev a2)
But after switching xorg.conf to use "nouveau", there was error saying that
no video device found.
Finally I followed.
http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/InstallNouveau
Compiled both drm and xf86-video-nouveau and replaced both libdrm and
/usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/nouveau_drv.so
Now it is working fine.

Of course. But the problems I had with Gnome and Xfce on this system occurr=
