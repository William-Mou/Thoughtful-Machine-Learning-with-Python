I respectfully disagree that a User Group can be truly "for profit".
As I stated, a for profit organization is out there to make money.
That's it's goal.  User Groups are designed to bring people together.
When looking at "what's good for the members" and "what makes money",
a for profit venture would decide on money.  While I'm sure it
wouldn't do something "bad" to it's members, ultimately by it's
definition it has to make a profit.  Nothing wrong with for profit
ventures, but to have someone volunteer in a for profit venture isn't
really volunteering.  It's giving of your time to make someone else
money.

I think the FCP groups are great, but are in a different league on
every level than Apple User Groups.  They have more in common with
Macworld and WWDC , IMHO

I think, respectfully that's an excuse.  When groups still debate
whether to support classic users, then it's gone from gradual change
to extinction.

Enlighten me.  I simply can't imagine a scenario where the ancient
discs of the month and printed newsletters make sense.  I know the
argument:  "Our members wanted printed newsletters",  "They are on
dialup and need these discs".  Is that leading?  Apple isn't targeting
people that don't have broadband internet connections.  They don't
even make phone modems anymore.  Those were discontinued.  These
aren't customers Apple wants to support or attract.  They want these
customers to enter the 21st century.

Oh yes they do.  I'm a shareholder and get to vote on nominees.  I
always vote to remove Bill Campbell.  Intuit treats the Mac like a
second class citizen.  Topic for a different day.  As a shareholder I
also get to go to the annual meeting, start shareholder initiatives
etc.  It's much more democratic than the way User Groups are run.

Alas, it would be nice if other voices join in.
