Nothing related to @synchronized. Your problem is that you are acquiring =
an unretained pointer to an object, then doing something that releases =
the object behind your back.

    number =3D [metadata objectForKey:key];

`number` now points to some object. Importantly, -objectForKey: just =
hands back the pointer, without doing the [[result retain] autorelease] =
dance. It's possible that the only thing that retained `number` is the =
`metadata` dictionary.

    [metadata setValue:something forKey:key];

Now `metadata` has released `number`. It may be dead.

You need to be careful with -objectForKey: and -objectAtIndex: while you =
are mutating the container. Those methods avoid autorelease for =
performance, but (as you found) it's also less safe.

Your solution of copy+autorelease is correct. retain+autorelease might =
be better.=20
