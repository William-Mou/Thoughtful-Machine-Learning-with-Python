(1) No need to CC me; I am subscribed to the list.

(2) I see that you (and a number of others) have had fun with parodies of
    the "give a fish / teach to fish" parable, but its point is still valid=
.

(3) If you are unwilling to teach, then there is no reason why your
    technological dependents would not be just as happy with an appropriate=
ly
    installed and configured Debian system as they would be with an Ubuntu
    system.

(4) If you are unwilling to teach, then don't come here for support, becaus=
e
    that's what you're asking us to do.  Why should we do for you what you
    are not willing to do for others?
