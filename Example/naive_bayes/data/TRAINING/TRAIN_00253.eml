Whoops, my last reply was accidentally sent directly Guy and not to
the list as I intended ...oops

Have never seen this bug with any jdk release from apple or current
IDEA setup.  Maybe you guys(meaning the people reporting bug) should
disable all plugins first and then re-enable one at a time until you
find the culprit?

Seems to work for me majority of time that unexplained errors like
this happen in IDEA.
