Hey all,

	I realize this has come up before, but I am still confused after  
reading through the old emails. I have an app that uses Quicktime for  
Java. I would like to, maybe not right away, but at some point, update  
my app to do the right thing. The right thing, apparently, is to use  
QTKit, because it is the only 64-bit solution.

	This seems crazy to me, though, because it is OS X specific, which  
means I need another solution for windows. What is the 64-bit solution  
(going to be) for windows? Does this mean every developer who wants to  
write cross-platform QT code (not just Java) is supposed to write  
their own portability layer for QuickTime? Is there an open source  
solution out there or in the works? Is there another solution that  
people are using other than QT?

I need file conversion from a wide variety of file types (esp audio)  
and video playback, although I will need some editing in the future.  
JMF+JavaSound won't cut it. Not even close. I need way more file  
formats than they support. You used to be able to use QTJ as a plugin  
for JMF to provide file reading/writing. Perhaps there is a way to do  
that with a minimal QT Java layer? Okay, now I'm just thinking out  
loud. Sorry.

	Any thoughts, advice pointers are appreciated. I have not seen the  
cross-platform issue addressed, and the only replacements for QTJ I've  
seen are OS Specific (eg rococoa).

thanks,

	bjorn
