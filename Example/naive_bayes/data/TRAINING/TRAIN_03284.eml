It does not, the kernel is sort of a self-decompressing binary.
However, the vga= parameter is indeed parsed by the bootloader and
passed to the kernel by a special protocol.  It's then used before the

Yes, you'll have to back out of Grub installation, start a shell, chroot
into /target, and install exlinux.  Take care to have /boot on an ext2
partition.
