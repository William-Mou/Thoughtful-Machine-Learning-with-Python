Thats cool. What about Lots of Little Files? That was another of the draws
of reiser3. I have a space I mount on /media/archive, which has everything
from mp3/oggs and movies, to books to a bunch of tiny files. This will
probably be the first victim for the xfs test partition.

nilfs2, btrfs and exofs are *definitely* still beta or even alpha.

Define "hates sudden power outages"...Is it recoverable?

Thanks for the info, Ron,
