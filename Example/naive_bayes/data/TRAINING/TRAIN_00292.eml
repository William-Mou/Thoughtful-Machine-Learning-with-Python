I have to force quit out of Netbeans once or twice a day, running
on Snow Leopard.  When I look at the log I see a cryptic error message
like this one:
4/19/10 4:04:24 PM	com.apple.launchd.peruser.501[98]	 
([0x0-0x14014].org.netbeans.ide.baseide.200912041610[182]) Exited with  
exit code: 143

Anyone have advice on preventing these problems?  Googling for 143
suggests it applies to a lot of different things, but might just be  
the JVM
telling me it has been killed.
