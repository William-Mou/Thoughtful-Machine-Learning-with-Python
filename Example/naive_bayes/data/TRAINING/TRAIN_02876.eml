14  Speaking of threats

      I got a FaceBook alert from a friend the other day, but it
looked a little suspect. It said "Look at you in this video, ha, ha!"

In the first place, she would never have written "ha, ha"
-- and the second point, the URL lead to an unfamiliar domain.

You did read my alert piece above, right? So, I immediately wrote
her at her email address and alerted her that the FaceBook
account had been compromised. A day later she wrote:

   > I have been told by our IS department that this is a
   >  very bad worm.  If you were also hijacked be sure to monitor
   >  your credit card and banking accounts regularly.
   >  Never click on any links in the future.  This has been a
   >  vicious attack and they had to go back two weeks on my
   > work pc and we still found at least 6 objects (Worm.Koobface)
   > through Malwarebytes and Sybot scans.

Need I say more?
