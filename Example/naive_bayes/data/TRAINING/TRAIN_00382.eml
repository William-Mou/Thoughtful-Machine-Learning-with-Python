I don't remember a thread on debian-user about UUIDs changing with
changing hardware (I could be wrong though!) but there was a thread in
March on ubuntu-users where a guy was duplicating disks for a rollout
and he was convinced that the BIOS of the boxes into which he was
plugging in the duplicated HDs was changing the UUIDs of the disks'
partitions because he was unable to boot from those disks unless he
changed the fstab to use /dev/sdaX devices. I pointed out that the
idea that a BIOS could change a filesystem's superblock didn't make
any sense and that it could not be a UUID problem because he could
boot boxes with Intel mobos but not boxes with another manufacturer's
mobos (I assume that he could have replied that the other mobos were
changing the UUIDs and the Intels ones not...).
