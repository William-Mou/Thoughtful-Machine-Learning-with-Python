I wouldn't say I'm new to it, but I'm not experienced. I write little snippets 
every now and again and edit system startup files etc.

This is certainly a challenge though. I guess if I can interface dyndns.org and 
smsclient relatively simply with options you mention, I'll probably manage it.

I might also put a check in there for other protocols like http, just in case 
ping happens to be the last protocol standing when the machine or connection is 
about to keel over! (thanks to Joe in the other msg for the tip)
