Hello l7-filter members.

This is just an update on how things are moving along with the l7-filter 
project changes.

SVN Import
----------

The l7-filter source code has been imported into SVN.  Darryl took the 
time and effort to create the repository with change history intact.
Feel free to take a look at the results:

http://code.clearfoundation.com/svn/listing.php?repname=l7-filter


Bug Tracker
-----------

The new bug tracker is also online.  The tracker is integrated with the 
SVN system.  It will also be integrated with build system and CI 
infrastructure at some point in the future.  Please let me know if you 
would like an account created!

http://l7-filter.clearfoundation.com/tracker/roadmap_page.php


Documentation
-------------

We are slowly be surely making some progress on migrating and updating 
the documentation.

http://l7-filter.clearfoundation.com/docs/


That's all for now.  We're making progress and you should see some 
l7-filter updates rolling out in June/July.

Peter Baldwin
ClearFoundation
