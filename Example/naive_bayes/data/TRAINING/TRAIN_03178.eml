Hi all

=46rom time to time I have to assess Flash projects, and to assist my =
marking a few years ago I wrote a program which uses a Scanner to open =
the .fla file and read it on a "line by line" basis.  Although this is =
really stretching what a Scanner should do, it has proven surprisingly =
useful over the years.

My original version of the software was written with an "old" Xcode =
style project using the now deprecated jam.  Recently I decided I needed =
to make some changes to it and I thought it would be a good move to =
transfer it to Netbeans --- and it didn't work!  The Scanner wouldn't =
read a .fla file when run from Netbeans, but it would when run from =
Xcode, using either a jam or ant type project.  It would also work if I =
navigated to the Netbeans "dist" folder and double clicked the jar =
directly. =20

The following code shows the problem:

      String fullFileName =3D "/Users/boblang1/Desktop/xxx.fla";
     =20
      try {
        Scanner in =3D new Scanner (new File (fullFileName));
        while (in.hasNextLine ()) {
          String line =3D in.nextLine ();
          System.out.println (line);
        }
      }
      catch (Exception e) {
        System.out.println ("Exception reading file: " + fullFileName);
        System.out.println (e);
      }

When run inside Xcode or by double clicking the jar, the Scanner reads =
the .fla file.  When run inside Netbeans, it appears to open the file =
but won't return any lines (the while loop terminates early).  There are =
no exceptions reported. =20

BTW, the problem only seems to happen with .fla files.  I can read .txt =
files quite successfully.

I'm running fully up to date Snow Leopard, with the latest developer =
preview Java. As far as I can tell, I don't have any older versions of =
Java on my computer.  All the versions in /System/Library appear to link =
to Java 1.6.=20

Any ideas?

Bob
