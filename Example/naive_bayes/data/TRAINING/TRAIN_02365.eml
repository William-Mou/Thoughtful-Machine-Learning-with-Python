I first want to know if I'm the only one and/or try to find the cause of the issue before filing a bug 
report.
But I'll start a separate thread for it.

Nope, hibernating does not work with the nvidia driver, but I didn't/couldn't test it with the 
nouveau driver, since I couldn't get a login screen to begin with and Ctl+Alt+F1 didn't respond 
either, so it was unusable for me.
Had to do Ctl+Alt+SysRq+(REISUB) and boot into single user mode to get my system working again.

Desktop effects seems to be disabled by default on laptops, so that's probably not it.
