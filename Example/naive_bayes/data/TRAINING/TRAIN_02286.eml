Debian users deserve quality packaging of upstream software, good integrati=

of it throughout the whole distribution and general assumption that it won'=

eat their kittens (yet data loss bugs happen). But whether upstream softwar=

which does, develop it by yourself, pay somebody to develop it for you or a=
sk=20
kindly and wait till somebody else is motivated enough to do it.

Move on. kdepim 4.3 is gone. Given that KDE SC 4.5 might release with kdepi=
m=20
from 4.4 anyway extending kdepim 4.4 codebase lifetime to 1 year, beating d=
ead=20
horse (4.3) makes absolutely no sense. I recommend you to face reality here.

> These responses are quite frustrating.  I read Ana's post as "please make

Don't you see that you always put yourself in the front in your rationales?=
=20
YOU run a dozen of DB servers, YOU don't want another one, YOU don't trust=
=20
MySQL, YOU say KDE 4.4 is inappropriate for stable. Nothing objective and Y=
OU=20
assume that your truth is an ultimate one. Pet bugs are always RC to the=20
reporter, but yet again, we need to face reality here. If YOU have so many=
=20
problems with particular piece of software, look for better options or read=

the first part of this mail again.
