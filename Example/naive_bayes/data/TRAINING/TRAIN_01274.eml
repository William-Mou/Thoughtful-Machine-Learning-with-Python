I think there may be some confusion here, Mr. Krafft.  The comments
I made above were not in reference to anything _you_ wrote.  They were
in reference to the original edition of "The Linux Cookbook", by
Michael Stutz, which was copyrighted in 2001.

   http://dsl.org/cookbook/cookbook_toc.html

I suggest that you go back and look more closely at my original post.
