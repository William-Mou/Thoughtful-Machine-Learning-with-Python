I think you should pick up a book that covers MVC in the iPhone world.
"Beginning iPhone 3 Development" by Dave Mark and JeffLaMarche is
probably your best bet.

That may be worthwhile.  Even if you had retained your 2002-era BNR
knowledge, the prevailing use of framework-provided view controllers
in UIKit is a pretty significant change with lots of interesting (and
mostly very positive) consequences.  Even some Cocoa old-timers had a
hard time grasping it at first--I'm living proof!  That being said, I
don't know if BNR is covering a lot of iPhone material now (though I
assume that's the case) or if they're still more Mac-focused, so check
first.
