We've taken OP to task already for this, but I guess it bears repeating.

Use multiple HW controllers, and at least 7-8 drives, I believe was the 
consensus, given that SW RAID 6 is a performance loser and losing a 
controller during a rebuild is a real ruin-your-week kind of moment.

But while some of us were skeptical about just how bad the performance 
of RAID 5 or 6 really is and wanted citation of references, more of us 
just questioned the perceived frugality.  With four drives, wouldn't a 
RAID 10 be better use of resources, since you can migrate to bigger 
setups later?  And there we were content to let it lie, until...

I have ceased to have an opinion on this, having been taken to task, 
myself, about it.  I believe the discussion degenerated into a nit-picky 
banter over the general suitability of XFS, but I may be wrong about this...

Seriously, ext4 is not suitable if you anticipate possible boot 
problems, unless you are experienced at these things.  The same is true 
of XFS.   If you *are* experienced, then more power to you.  Although, I 
would have assumed a very experienced person would have no need to ask 
the question.

Someone pointed out what I have come to regard as the best solution, and 
that is to make /boot and / (root) and the usual suspects ext3 for 
safety, and use ext4 or XFS or even btrfs for the data directories.

(Unless OP were talking strictly about the data drives to begin with, a 
possibility I admit I may have overlooked.)


Have I summarized adequately?
