does somebody here is using it (also in production)?
I want to cross check some things.
I'm not using network manager, because the stupid thing is waiting for me to

mounted before I login

be sure I've done this already .. this option is disabled too

this is a good idea, I'll try. I've actually tried but only to see if evo is

again.

if someone is reading mails with evolution 2.30 from exchange please give me
a note.
