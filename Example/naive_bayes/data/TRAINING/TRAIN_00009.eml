What "long, rude, unpleasant emails" have I sent to you? Go ahead,
post everything that I've ever sent to you here. I've sent mails only
as long as the demands of your comments have warranted, filled only
with questions about what is broken for you in KDE 4 and links to bugs
on those very subjects. Rude or unpleasant? I think that you have me
mistaken. I'll give to you the benefit of the doubt, publish something
that you think I wrote to you which is rude or unpleasant.

Which messages exactly? "last two" is hard to identify given the
dynamic nature of this list.

All I did was ask about what issues you have with KDE 4 so that I
might fix them. You don't have to appreciate that, but I do not expect
you to turn it around and call that "rude and unpleasant". Maybe you
don't like KDE contributors taking an interest in your problems with
the software. Many other people do.
