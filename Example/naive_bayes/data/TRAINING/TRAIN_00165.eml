Thanks for this answer. There are *many* reasons not to use pdfLaTeX.
They do not enter in the scope of this mailing list, but I am pretty
sure you will find them directly on the Internet. For example, pdfLaTeX
encourages one to use directly JPG, etc., for the inclusion in the
document, which is pretty bad. There are also many incompatibilities
with different packages.

Note that, under Windows, I remember that acrord32.exe always blocked
the file for writing, even if it was only being read by acrord32.exe.
Okay, it's Windows. Bad memories.
