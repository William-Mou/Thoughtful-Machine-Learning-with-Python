Greetings;

I have looked for ways to fix this problem several times in 
the passed few months and have had no success.

Recently several companies have started displaying a large 
favicon in the address bar when you go to their site. In 
several cases it takes up over half of the space in the 
address bar and makes it extremely difficult to read the URL.

One site even claimed that this is a "security feature" as 
it would enable the users to tell they were really on the 
bank's site and not some scammer of phisher site. Sure! Like 
nobody else could figure out how to do that!

Anyway, can anyone tell me how to get rid of these eyesores?
I have already set browser.chrome.favicons and 
browser.chrome.site_icons to false and 
browser.chrome.image_icons.max_size to 0, but no difference!

TIA for any help!

Dennis
