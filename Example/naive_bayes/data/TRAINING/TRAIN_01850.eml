On Thursday 06 May 2010 it was so written:
> So, let me ask the above question again: where is your code ?

I was thinking about getting all obsequious and fawning at the High 
Priests of Development, to verbally bow in thanks for the scraps of 
code that we mere users are able to pick up off the ground after the 
Priests have passed, but then I realized that there are lots of 
people for whom English isn't a first language, and sarcasm doesn't 
work in email very well anyway.

What's left for a user to do? As Nate put it a moment ago, just move 
on.

> Are _you_ interested in doing it ?

Backporting KDE4 applications to a KDE3 working environment is beyond 
my skills. I can't even get Squeeze KDM to use a different background 
as it is.

> At that game, there are two types of players: those who rant and
> contribute to fix the root of their rant (aka code) and those who
> rant and do nothing.

Going back to obsequious pandering is looking very tempting. Yes, us 
mere users have nothing to contribute, since we don't write code.

> We are all volunteers and among those volunteers, nobody is

Indeed. And I assure you, that fact is not lost on anyone.

> Ranting wont change the facts.

Let them eat cake.
