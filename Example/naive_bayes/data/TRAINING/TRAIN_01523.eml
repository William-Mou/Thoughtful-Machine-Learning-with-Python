  Just for the record, it actually *is* possible to boot off a partition
that's in RAID1, but you might have to use grub.  The reason it works
is because grub can read past the md-raid1 metadata without getting
confused -- since the raid is not running when grub is looking at the
disks, it only sees one of the two, but since they're mirrored, and
since grub doesn't *write* to the partition, everything works.

  I have several production systems that do this.

  It's a bit complicated to set up, but generally, it goes
something like:

  - Install a basic system onto one drive, with the correct
      size of partition (call this /dev/sda1).
  - Set up an "incomplete" RAID1 array, with one device and
      one missing, with the second drive -- this is /dev/md0,
      consisting of /dev/sdb1 and an empty slot.
  - Configure /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf, and re-build your initramfs
      so that it has the md modules and knows about the array.
  - Mount /dev/md0 somewhere and copy all the data off /dev/sda1 to it.
      It's very important to get the *new* initramfs onto the array.
  - Install grub in the bootloader of the 2nd drive. (The installer
      already did this for the first one). This actually isn't
      essential, but you may need it if/when /dev/sda fails.
  - Boot on to the incomplete RAID array -- root=/dev/md0.
  - Add /dev/sda1 to the array, and sync.

  Now you have a bootable software raid-1 system.

  I'm not saying this solves the OP's problem, necessarily,
but it's perfectly possible.  I've never tried it with LILO
or grub2, but I would think it would work.
