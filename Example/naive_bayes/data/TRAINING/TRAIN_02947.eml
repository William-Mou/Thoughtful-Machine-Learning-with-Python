Well, I didn't try them all, but both evince and xpdf do the same thing.
And yes, it seems to be every multi-page PDF file.

Well, that makes the image slightly smaller, but I still get a blank
page between every printed page.

Further testing leads me to believe that this problem is driver-specific.
When I print to another printer, an IBM Proprinter II, I do not have
this problem.  I see that in Lenny the ghostscript pj driver is used
and in Squeeze they have switched to the hplis driver.  Perhaps upgrading
to Squeeze may fix the problem.  In the meantime, I'm going to do some
experimenting with the ghostscript driver directly and see what I can
see.
