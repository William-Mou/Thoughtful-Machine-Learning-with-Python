=46irst its IMHO.

Second its from what I understood about the different purposes of debian-
kde and qt-kde-ml mailing lists.

And debian-kde is clearly sorted as users mailing list:

Debian in KDE
http://lists.debian.org/users.html

debian-qt-kde: Packages using Qt and/or KDE
http://lists.debian.org/devel.html

So I think my view is not that far off.

So or so: Your posts did not seem to me to bring anyone even the slightest=
=20
bit forward towards having KDE 3.5.

So I finish with a suggestion, how this can work:

=2D--------------------------------------------------------------------
Hi developers and users of Debian in KDE,

I set up an Alioth project repository of KDE 3.5 packages that I forward-
ported to Squeeze at:

http://some-alioth-url

Right now I started just with the forward port of the basic KDE packages.

I like to continue that work and to make the package co-installable with=20
KDE 4.=20

I appreciate any helping hand. If you are a user and want to use KDE 3 I=20
encourage you to try may package. Please note they are not co-installable=20
with KDE 4 in the moment. If you are a developer please help me with=20
building and polishing packages.

If you want to help out, subscribe to mailinglist xyz.

Regards,
Mike
=2D--------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, how about that, Mike? How about being the change you want to achieve?

Thanks.

Note: KDE 3.5 doesn't really need to be co-installable for those only=20
interested in KDE 3.5. At least not initially.

Just a small start might pull this off for you. But if you do not *act*,=20
probably nothing will happen. You can't change those who are not=20
interested in providing KDE 3.5 for Debian Squeeze. So either you start=20
pulling it off for yourself or it - unless someone else feels the=20
motivation to do it - *will just not happen*.

Its as easy as that.

Ciao,
=2D-=20
