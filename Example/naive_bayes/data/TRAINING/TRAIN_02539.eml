After logging in as somebody with administrator privileges, I *was*
able to select the 'In their own process' preference, and Safari then
worked as advertised. I was also then able to change this preference
from my own account (without admin privileges).

Re the lack of two-finger scrolling in Chrome own-process applets,
this turns out to occur only when the browser window is on my
secondary display(!) (plugged into my MacBook), and applies to Safari
as well. This I describe in a bug report I've just submitted.
