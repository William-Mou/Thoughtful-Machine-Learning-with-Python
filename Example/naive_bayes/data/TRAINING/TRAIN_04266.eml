don't understand why this would be the case.  I have a static =
initializer in that class, and that's where it is loading and calling =
that native method.  How can the class not be found if that's where the =
native method is being called from?

Think about it: you are calling your JNI function from the class' static =
initializer. The class is not initialized yet. Attempts to find the =
(uninitialized) class should probably fail.
