Yes.  The X server is completely secondary, and I don't think Apple Java
interacts with it at all.

Right.

If you are using AWT, you need to give your program access to the
console.  Apple uses a Mach-involved security model of namespaces to
control access to various things; you can find more information on it at
http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/technotes/tn2005/tn2083.html.
Worth reading.  Several times.

But the pertinent bit is ``A process can only use the global window
server service if its EUID is 0 (it's running as root) or matches the
UID of the console user. All other users are barred from using it.''

I don't see an update of this document for 10.6, either.

You could try installing another Java that includes a client Xlib
implementation, and go from there.  Or, of course, run your program on
Linux or FreeBSD or OpenSolaris instead.
