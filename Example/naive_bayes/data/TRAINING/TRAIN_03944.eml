Of course. But the problems I had with Gnome and Xfce on this system 
occurred not only in Squeeze, but also when running an Ubuntu LTS 
version and Debian Stable. I only saw those problems when using the 
restricted / glx drivers. Never with nv or vesa. I think this is, 
perhaps, more a measure of the card itself than the drivers. But I know 
a number of people with "high end" graphics cards from nvidia who have 
reported the same sorts of issues that I saw. It doesn't really matter 
much as these particular systems are no longer used as graphics 
workstations. As they've aged we stuck Linux on them and use them as 
admin workhorses, a job for which they are admirably suited because of 
all of the screen real estate.

Yes. In my earlier experiences I would just wipe the drive and start 
over when I suspected that hangovers from previous experiments with 
drivers were getting in the way of new configurations. But after I 
became comfortable with a few different methods of installation and 
initial configuration I started paying attention to things like 
dpkg-reconfigure and debconf-show.
