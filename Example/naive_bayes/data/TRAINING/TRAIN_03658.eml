It should be noted that the  --ghost option of automount will create
an appropriate "ghost" directory for the device's mount point. For the
above auto.master stanza you could use:
  /var/autofs/usb /etc/auto.usb --timeout=### --ghost

This can lead to a cluttered /var/autofs/usb directory, however,
unless you do some udev-based scripting to manage things on the fly.
