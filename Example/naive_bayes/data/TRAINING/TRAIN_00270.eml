Yes, exactly.  We are hoping that, as we build our business and become
cash positive, a part of our profits can be used to shore up those areas
where FOSS is still weak as a desktop solution.  We have just put out

3.5 so it is robust enough for Enterprise use and integration with
Zimbra.  A viable PDF editor is high on our list - John
