I also have been using debian-multimedia for LAME mp3 and am very thankful
for its existence.  The file was a quicktime .mov file they made with their
own camera and is on their machine so unfortunately I cannot get a snippet
of it.

FWIW, I did 2 fresh Lenny installs on my friend's machine, the first one
with debian-multimedia which resulted in the .mov file not playing back in
mplayer, and a subsequent second Lenny install, identical to the first
except without the debian-multimedia, in which the .mov file played great in
mplayer.  I don't know if it's a bug or not, but has anyone else had this
specific problem (with .mov files in mplayer)?  If so I will gladly file the
bug report.  I've read about several different bugs with mplayer on various
forums but have not seen this one specifically.

Thank you,
Mark
