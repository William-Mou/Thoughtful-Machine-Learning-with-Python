Hi all,

with respect to my problem that the video callback is triggered more =
often than I want to (see below) I had a guess that it is related to the =
device frame rate. In that context I tried to set the frame rate of my =
inbuilt iSight to 1 and SGGetFrameRate did confirm this:=20

  err =3D SGSetFrameRate(videoData->sgchanVideo,IntToFixed(1));
  Fixed *frameRate;
  SGGetFrameRate(videoData->sgchanVideo,frameRate);
  int rate =3D FixedToInt(*frameRate);
  cout << "FrameRate: " << rate << endl;  //// PLOTS 1 WHEN EXECUTING

However, when I execute the app the frame size is much higher (I guess =
30 fps or more). I saw an older post from 2007, which dealt with the =
same problem of not being able to set the inbuilt iChat frame rate but =
nobody replied. Does anyone have a guess how to approach this problem ?

Thanks in advance

Hi all,

I have a thread, which triggers the SGIdle call according to my desired =
frame rate:

void video::run(){
 while (running){
   sj->dFC->videoBlocker->lock();
   sj->dFC->videoWaiter->wait(sj->dFC->videoBlocker);

   err =3D SGIdle(videoData->seqGrab);
   usleep(1000000/1);   //// FRAMERATE

   sj->dFC->videoBlocker->unlock();
 }
}

In this example the thread waits for 1 second before executing the next =
time, which results in a frame rate of 1 fps. However, I discovered some =
 strange system behavior, which forced me to verify if this is really =
the case: I applied a time measurement between each data proc function =
call and in fact it is executed 4 more times ins between in approx. 250 =
microsecond intervals. In the following I have plotted the measured =
interval times in ms:

1000.38
0.026
0.023
0.024
0.027
1002.55
0.025
0.026
0.022
0.021
1002.61
0.026
0.021
0.02
0.024
1002.54
0.026
0.023
0.024
0.02
1000.18
0.026
0.137
0.025
0.024

etc .... and so forth. This is actually not happening when I reside =
above a framerate of 25 fps. Can anyone tell me why this is happening =
and how I can prevent this to happen ?=20

Thanks a lot in advance, best
