In Thomas' defense, I noticed the same thing and had much the same reaction.  

The Squeeze KDE 4.4 update this week pulled down network-manager as a dependency.  In my case I much prefer wicd to handle my wireless.  

The update had them both running simultaneously, which I didn't like at all.  I was plugged into my wired network, which wicd had set up as default, and network-manger connected to one of the wireless networks I had configured.  Both interfaces up, even two default routes.  Yuk.

I didn't like the fact that the KDE update ignored my current install of wicd to install network-manager, and when I purged network-manager KDE worked (and continues to work) just fine.

So the "dependency" on network-manager seems to be merely a preference of the KDE team.  To me that means I should not have seen network-manager if I already had wicd installed.  This is very similar to the various packages that insist they need avahi-daemon to work, and yet purging avahi-daemon doesn't break anything not using mDNS.

So while Thomas could file a bug, I don't think it's not germane to complain about DDs putting everything under the sun into a dependency list.  Here's the place for the community to decide whether we really need to force an install of network-manager (or avahi) when they're not really needed, or decide that because some cases might require it everyone should have it.

Anyway, just my 2c

James ------------------------------------ 

Only time I have incurred this is when I have preferences set to
include "recommended" files as "dependencies" thereby passing control
of the upgrade to the system. Not a good idea BTW!! I use synaptic most
of the time & I suspect aptitude has a similar setting. command line
updates do not have this issue.:-)
