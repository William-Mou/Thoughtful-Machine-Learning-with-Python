Ive bee using Chrome dev channel version for several months now.  I like the 
fact that each tab has its on process.  If one crashed it does not take the 
whole browser with it.  I watch a lot of flash videos on hulu, etc and when 
flash crashes or I loose audio from flash all I have to do is terminate the 
flash process from chrome's own task manager and restart the video.  I use 2 
monitors and when I watch videos on one screen I some time browse the web in 
another chrome window on the second monitor.  I may have many tabs open which I 
don't want to close just to restart flash when it fails like I would in 
Firefox.  I do use adblock for chrome but I have not seen it do mush for 
blocking adds.
