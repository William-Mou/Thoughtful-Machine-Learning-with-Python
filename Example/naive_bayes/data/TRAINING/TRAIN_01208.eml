<!-- The languid figure leaned back in the chair with an air of resignation. I'm sure I don't know why they cook the dinners up so high, she murmured, pettishly, to her husband. Why can't they stick the kitchens underground--in the hold, I mean--instead of bothering us up here on deck with them?  -->

<script>Diane had disappeared. The crack of the postilion's whip told Victurnien that the fair romance of his first love was over. While peril lasted, Diane could still see her lover in the young Count; but out of danger, she despised him for the weakling that he was. </p>p>Du Croisier himself, urged by President du Ronceret, appealed from the finding of the Tribunal to the Court-Royal, and lost his cause. The Liberals throughout the department held that little d'Esgrignon was guilty; while the Royalists, on the other hand, told frightful stories of plots woven by that abominable du Croisier to compass his revenge. A duel was fought indeed; the hazard of arms favored du Croisier, the young Count was dangerously wounded, and his antagonist maintained his words. This affair embittered the strife between the two parties; the Liberals brought it forward on all occasions. Meanwhile du Croisier never could carry his election, and saw no hope of marrying his niece to the Count, especially after the duel.  How much do they pay you for that?  </script><meta name="description" content="Selling our news columns? " />
