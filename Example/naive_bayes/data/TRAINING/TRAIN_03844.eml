Hello,

I have a web-service that produces static images from various sources =
using Quartz.

Recently I wanted to add the capability of adding QTMovie screenshots =
there, but I'm having some issues.

When the service is run by a user which currently has a graphical login, =
it works fine - I can load a QTMovie, and grab a frame from a specific =
time to be used in the image export.


However, in the production environment, the app is run by a user which =
is not logged in. Everything else (Quartz) works fine, but QTMovie =
loading bails out with this:

=
/SourceCache/QTOtherComponents/QuickTime-1674/MidVale/AVA_VP3_QT/Component=
/AVA_HDUtilitiesHW.c: CGGetOnlineDisplayList failed with code 1011=20
=
/SourceCache/QTOtherComponents/QuickTime-1674/MidVale/AVA_VP3_QT/Component=
/AVA_HDUtilitiesHW.c: CGGetOnlineDisplayList failed with code 1011=20
_RegisterApplication(), FAILED TO establish the default connection to =
the WindowServer, _CGSDefaultConnection() is NULL
=
/SourceCache/QTOtherComponents/QuickTime-1674/MidVale/AVA_VP3_QT/Component=
/AVA_HDUtilitiesHW.c: CGGetOnlineDisplayList failed with code 1011=20

Is there a way to work around this? I only want to get the poster image =
from that movie, nothing else. I can detect in my code when I'm not =
connected to the windowserver with CGGetOnlineDisplayList, so I can =
switch to a different code path if required.

Regards,
Orestis Markou=
