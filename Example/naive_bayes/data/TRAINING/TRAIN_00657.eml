No, didn't have time when I needed it and when I don't I don't have time to
do the deb building.

Sorry, I can not help you in this. I just downloaded the tora code and
compiled it against my oracle sdk which is in the /opt/oracle dir. (I mean
I've put it there and setup all I need to use it thisway)

So you are asking me how I did manage to compile it in kde 3.5?

First you need the sdk. I've put it in each version dir respectively. This
is an extra package.

Also why would you convert something from rpm to deb, when you can go to the
vendor and download for free the real code?

I've downloaded and put all I need in /opt/oracle

ll /opt/oracle/

export TNS_ADMIN="/opt/oracle/network/admin"
export PATH=/opt/oracle/instantclient_11_1:$PATH

./configure --prefix=/usr --with-instant-client \
        --with-oracle-includes=/opt/oracle/instantclient_11_1/sdk/include \
        --with-oracle-libraries=/opt/oracle/instantclient_11_1  \
        --with-oci-version=11G

make
make install

that's it.

I have to admit that for me the biggest challenge was to download the
packages I need from the Oracle site.

I remember I've tried to debianize once but it failed and I gave up, because
I didn't have the time.

regards
