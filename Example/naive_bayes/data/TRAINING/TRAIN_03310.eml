I've read articles which state that ext3 has superior resilience to
sudden power loss.  That sentiment has been echoed in this thread, by
Stan I think, with statements like (paraphrasing):  XFS is good for
production servers which have uninterruptible power supplies.

The resilience is due to the way the journal is written, if I
understand correctly.  Maybe somebody on this list who understands it
better can confirm or deny.  There is a journal_data_writeback option
for ext3 which will speed up writes to the filesystem, but reduce its
resilience to power loss.  With this option enabled, I recall reading
that the ext3 benchmarks are pretty similar to XFS.

I'm not an expert, so don't take my word for it.  Do some research on it
yourself, or wait for the real experts to chime in and correct me :)
