You missed my point completely. What is subjectively unusable for you, is=20
perfectly usable for others and the other way round. Debian is not your=20
personal distro, it strives to keep balance. And balance is towards 4.4 sid=
e=20
you like it or not due to many factors. When Squeeze is released, KDE 4.5 m=
ay=20
be in .3 or later patch release upstream so the point about the latest and=

greatest here is completely out-of-place.

Now if at particular time upstream software does not meet your personal nee=

you go and look for alternatives. You talk like kdepim 4.3 was flawless. Bu=
t=20
it wasn't! There is no place for "software does not do X, remove it from=20
stable" discussions here.

Insisting that others do something (revert to kdepim 4.3) based solely on y=
our=20
personal grievances does not help productive communication.

I've never said that you're the only one. I find myself in the odd position=
=20
that I mostly share opinion with you about excessive "explosion" of DB serv=
er=20
instances on the desktop but I still can't help myself to argue. You starte=
d=20
this off on a wrong foot by demanding to accommodate to your needs.

What facts? That kdepim/kmail needs akonadi? That's hardly news. Akonadi=20
integration is not stable enough? There is still time to improve it. That's=
=20
what Ana's blog was about.

It is not like every mail client on the market suddenly needs MySQL. Actual=

kmail is probably unique in this area.

What I tried to say to you all this time, if Akonadi renders Kmail unusable=
 to=20
you, switch the client! Akonadi by itself is not a bug, it is not going awa=
y!=20
Take it or switch to something else, simple as that.
