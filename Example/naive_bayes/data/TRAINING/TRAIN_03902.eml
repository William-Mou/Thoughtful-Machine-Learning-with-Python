Hi Guy,
                The problem is caused by an NPE in the Swing =
accessibility code when a JList subclass overrides the =
getAccessibleContext() method and returns null. You can hit this crash =
when using a tool that scans the IntelliJ UI using the Accessibility =
API. We believe we have a fix for it, but as a workaround if you avoid =
using tools that use Accessibility with IntelliJ, you can avoid the =
crash.

Thanks,
Bino George,
Java Runtime Engineer,
Apple Inc.
