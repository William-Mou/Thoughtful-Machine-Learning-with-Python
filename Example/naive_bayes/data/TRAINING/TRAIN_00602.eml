no but it's definitely an issue if you can not arrange your displays.

yes, I know. I'll check ... I have about  10 application to recompile.

For now it has happened twice ... it could be that I have
installed/configured something after logging in the first time. 

What is happening permanently is that if I click the logout button the whole
desktop freezes. I have to press CTRL+ALT+F[1-6] to restart kdm

What I am missing now is also the old behavior from CTRL+ALT+DEL to get
prompt for reboot or shutdown - or whatever. Now this combination is
locking the screen. Was it adopted from newer windows?

Well, 
- kplayer was not working for DVB input.
- korganizer does not start
- kweather and kmoon are not visible (can not choose to activate), though it
states it's installed.

- ALL kde apps like kplayer/organizer and probably others start very slowly
about 20-30secs to pop up


I'm sorry but I can not test anything that fast. it will take few weeks.

I will probably test upgrading (As I said) from lenny to squeeze to sid. To
simulate an upgrade of my current system. I think this is more important.
This will take a while, so my plan for now is to see what basically works
and what not.
