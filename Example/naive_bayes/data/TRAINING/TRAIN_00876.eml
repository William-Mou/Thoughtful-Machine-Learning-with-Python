YES

Is this realistic description?  It is usually lazy mantainer or dead
upstream which delay such fixes.  Upstream fix should likely be around
if someone fixed that for stable.

I see... I now think placing pointer to FAQ should be good idea to
explain all these issues.

I need to think think about the context of these.  This was in
section describing "archive".  (I have other place where I say "For your
**production server**, the `stable` suite with the security updates is
recommended.")  

So I am updating as:

TIP: If "`sid`" is used in the above example instead of
"`@-@codename-stable@-@`", the "`deb: http://security.debian.org/ ...`"
line for security updates in the "`/etc/apt/sources.list`" is not
required.   This is because there is no security update archive for
"`sid`" (`unstable`).

NOTE: The security bugs for the `stable` archive are fixed by the Debian
security team.  This activity has been quite rigorous and reliable.
Those for the `testing` archive may be fixed by the Debian testing
security team.  For several reasons, this activity is not as rigorous as
that for `stable` and you may need to wait for the migration of fixed
`unstable` packages.  Those for the `unstable` archive are fixed by the
individual maintainer.  Actively maintained `unstable` packages are
usually in a fairly good shape by leveraging latest upstream security
fixes. See http://www.debian.org/security/faq[Debian security FAQ]
for how Debian handles security bugs.
