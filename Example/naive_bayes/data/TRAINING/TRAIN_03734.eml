My current group is too small to worry about thanking them in any =20
major way.  Of we all thank each other.  We have 4 regular volunteers =20=

and currently having a different member each month volunteering to do =20=

a presentation.  Only occasionally having an outside speaker. =20
Sometimes via iChat.

When I was with HAUS in Honolulu, we thanked the volunteers by buying =20=

them pizza each month at the board meetings.  In Boston, we had an =20
annual meeting of "activists".  400 strong.  Then we had an annual =20
picnic for volunteers as well.

I think it never hurts to thank people every chance you can get.

Lynn
