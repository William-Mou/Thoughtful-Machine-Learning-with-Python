But the key is restarting the X server, not necessarily a logout and
login to the GNOME desktop.  A login/logout sequence is simply the most
common way to restart the X server.  The X server can only start once
safely.  After that, who knows what VT it will end up on, and what parts
of the old instance of the server will get terminated.  Has anyone seen
something like this on a non-Nvidia driver (not nv and not nvidia)?
